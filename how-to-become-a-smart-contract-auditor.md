HOW TO BECOME A SMART CONTRACT AUDITOR

---
From time to time, I receive messages asking me for advice on how to get started as a smart contract security auditor. While there are already articles written about this topic, most of them are just a collection of security-related articles which they throw at beginners, overwhelming them. Iâ€™ll provide a path that I would take if I had to do it all over again. This will be ETH specific (or more general EVM-specific) as most auditing work is currently still in this ecosystem. At the end, I'll go over frequently asked questions that are related to auditing and getting your first job.

# Who made me the Expert?
Who am I (chmichel) and why should you even listen to me?
I'm currently an independent security researcher who has worked at traditional auditing firms before, so I know both sides. You don't need to listen to me but if you reached out to me, you probably have your own reasons why you think my advice is valuable. At the time of writing, I'm currently ranked #1 auditor at Code4arena, how much weight you want to give to this ranking is again up to you.

# Learn Programming
I except that you already know how to code, any language is fine. If not, learning how to code should be your first step as auditing code requires being able to read it. In my opinion, being a developer is a prerequisite, otherwise, you're spending too much time trying to make sense of the syntax and the semantics of the individual instructions. It'd be like trying to read Nietzsche while being illiterate. Become literate first. This is definitely the step that takes the most time to learn, learning the security aspects happens a lot faster.
If you have no prior programming experience, be mentally prepared that it'll take you years before your reviews will be useful. I'd start with JavaScript, it's the most beginner-friendly and versatile language. If it turns out you don't actually like being an auditor, the transition to being a frontend, backend or smart contract developer is easy. The syntax of Solidity and JavaScript are also somewhat similar.

# Learn ETH blockchain & Solidity Basics
So you know how to code now but don't know anything about Ethereum and Solidity yet. The quickest way to learn a new language is by using it in practice, by writing code in it- reading only the docs does not make the knowledge stick (and for some reason, even after all these years I still find the Solidity docs confusing and unstructured). There's no better way to combine learning Solidity with learning about ETH security than solving CTFs. 
NOTE: CTFs (Capture The Flags/ War games) are security challenges where vulnerable code is presented and you need to write a smart contract to exploit the vulnerability.
These are the three CTFs I personally solved to learn Solidity and the language:
-> Damn Vulnerable DeFi
-> Ethernaut
-> Capture The Ether
The Ethernaut and Capture The Ether challenges often overlap and some vulnerabilities only apply to old Solidity versions. You won't see them in modern code anymore; be aware of that.
NOTE: These CTFs were originally made to be run against an Ethereum tenet for which it's hard to get any ETH funds and the development experience is very cumbersome. I recommend an alternative approach of using modern testing frameworks & forking to solve these challenges, it's described in my Ethernaut Solutions posts. You can clone my GitHub repo to start with the same setup.
There are also CTFs that are a lot harder, like Paradigm's CTF. Scoring well in these shows that you know what you're doing and they are great for getting hired, especially if you're unknown. All major auditing firms reached out to me after my solutions blog post with the call-to-action at the end.

# Become familiar with the most used smart contracts
There are certain contracts, patterns or even algorithms that you will see over and over again during your auditing career. It's good to become familiar with them and deeply understand how they work and their nuances.
-> Token Contracts: The most used token standards are EIP20 for fungible tokens, and EIP721 for NFTs. There are many more, but these two are all you need to know in the beginning. It's important to understand that the original ERC20 standards evolved a lot and there are tokens that do not comply with the final EIP20 (most notably USDT), which does not return a successful boolean among other issues. You should also understand that tokens can have different decimals and they're to be interpreted as a floating-point number with the decimals precision, i.e, `1e18 TOKENS (= 10**18 TOKENS) ~ 1.0 TOKENS` for a token with 18 decimals. You'll encounter a lot of bugs where some computed token amount is in the wrong number of decimals.
-> Proxies: Ethereum contracts are not upgradeable. If you want to update the code, you need to deploy a new contract. However, that means that the storage which still resides in the original contract is also lost. Thus proxies implement the idea to separate the storage from the logic. There are many different proxy implementations, have a look at the OpenZeppelin Proxy. You should understand how delegate call is essential for building proxies.
-> Compound: I'd say Compound is the basis for all decentralized peer-to-peer lending protocols. You should know it as a lot of DeFi primitives interact with lending protocols in some way. The code is also cleaner than Dave's and it's great example of what good documentation looks like. It Governor & TimeLock contracts are used as governance contracts of many other protocols as well. You should notice the similarities between the MasterChef reward algorithm and the way debt is accrued for the user through borrowIndex. 
-> UniswapV2: While Uniswap is already on V3, Uniswap V2 is significantly simpler, less gas-golfed, and still the basis of understanding automated market makers (AMMs) in general. You should also understand how LP tokens (more generally, share tokens that give you a fair share of an underlying balance) work.
